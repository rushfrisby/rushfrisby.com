Here are the conferences I am going to this year. If you’d like to meet up let me know!

**Automotive Megatrends**  
*March 15-17, Detroit*  
 They’ve broken up this conference into three one day conferences: [Connected Car Detroit](http://connectedcardetroit.com/), [Autonomous Car Detroit](http://autonomouscardetroit.com/), and [Fuel Economy Detroit](http://fueleconomydetroit.com/). It’s in the car manufacturing capital of the world. At [Derive Systems](http://derivesystems.com/) we are all about connected cars and fuel efficiency so this conference is a perfect venue for learning and sharing. We are not doing anything with autonomous (self driving) cars yet but the topic has come up.

**Build**  
*March 30-April 1, San Fransisco*  
[Build](https://build.microsoft.com/) is Microsoft’s most important developer conference. They show off the newest stuff and make big announcements. There are so many tracks and sessions that there will be no downtime. Each day will be spent trying to cram every last piece of knowledge into my brain. Our CEO and several other Derive employees live in San Fransisco so I’m looking forward to meeting up with them. I don’t think I will have enough time but I’d like to hit up the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz if I can.

**DEF CON 24**  
*August 4-7, Las Vegas*  
[DEF CON](https://www.defcon.org/) is a large and elite hacker conference. This is the kind of place you don’t take a computer to, and you turn off your cell phone, for fear of being hacked. Conferences like this usually have a shame board where people who are hacked get publicly mocked. The FBI shows up (somewhat undercover-there are also “spot the fed” games) They don’t sell tickets online or take credit cards once you’re there – nope, cash only! This conference is still up in the air for me because there is a [triathlon/vacation that I would like to take in Siesta Key](http://www.multirace.com/events/26) the same weekend. Maybe I will go to [Hope 11](https://hopeconf.wordpress.com/) instead.
