![/dev/tty MT3 Custom Keycap Set](/img/keyboard/dev_tty.png)

These keycaps are based on the profile from IBM beamspring terminals of the 1970s, this custom set is the first-ever fully sculpted set of dye-sublimated PBT keycaps in Hi-Profile.

Many computer terminals of old were constructed with a slanted switch layout from front to back. Because of that slant the keycaps sat at an angle atop the switches. This set is a reimagination of that unique slanted build, but optimized for modern keyboards. Thanks to significant 3D modeling work from Matt3o the MT3 profile is born!

The built quality of this set is impeccable. The plastic is think and the dye-sublimated are super clean and have a fantastic sound. The lip and cup on the top of the caps contour finger tips perfectly. On top of that the color tone is very pleasing. I got the RGB modifiers which give the set a pop of color.

By far my favorite keycaps ever!
