I found out this week that VS Code has extensions that anyone can write so I wanted to give it a try.

The extension I created is called “Encryptor” and what it does is add commands that will allow you do encrypt or decrypt an entire document or the currently selected text within a document.

AES 256 is used as the encryption algorithm.

Check it out on the Visual Studio Marketplace – [Encryptor for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RushFrisby.Encryptor).
