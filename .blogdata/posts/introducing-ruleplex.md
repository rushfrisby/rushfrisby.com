Almost a year ago I began on a mission to create the first cloud-based rules engine. I called it [RulePlex](https://ruleplex.com). After a few months of work I had succeeded. A lot of rules engines can be run (on virtual machines) in the cloud but mine was designed with a cloud-first approach in mind. On top of being cloud-based I had a couple of other goals I wanted for the engine:

</div>- Allow rules to be written in any language
- Allow integration with any app
- Make it incredibly secure
- Keep the cost low

I accomplished all of these. The engine was awesome. When I was at a good place to ease up on the development, I did, and started to connect with as many people as I could trying to drum up business. I contacted all of my developer buddies, business contacts, previous employers… but no one was interested. I tried to generate business by presenting my software at business start-up events like [1MillionCups](http://orlando.sites.1millioncups.com/). I tried Google Adwords. I threw a hail mary to [Scott Hanselman](https://twitter.com/shanselman) hoping he would do a [hanselminutes](http://hanselminutes.com/) with me. I even gave the service away for free just to get signups so people would look at it… but all of my attempts at getting the business going failed. I don’t think I did enough even though it may sound like I had.

**I’m not giving up.**

*I’m changing things up!*

Instead of being cloud-based I am falling in line with all of the other rule engines. RulePlex will be an on-premise install. It can still be run in the cloud but it won’t be touted as the first cloud-based rules engine any more. It’s nice that I was able to accomplish that feat but ultimately I think proximity to where it will be used will benefit companies more. The latency between the cloud an a corporate network is too much when apps need instant results.

Another thing I am changing is the ability to write rules in any language. I had support for JavaScript, C#, VB.NET, Ruby, and Python – but from now on rules will only be written in JavaScript. By going with only one language it will save development time tremendously. I chose JavaScript because it is the most widely used language today. It’s also not going anywhere anytime soon. It has become an incredible server side language thanks to [V8](https://code.google.com/p/v8/) and the popularity of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). It’s flexible/forgiving thanks to dynamic typing and business users can learn the basics easily.

The last thing I will be doing is blogging a lot more about RulePlex. I’ve been working on it for almost a year and I haven’t written anything (directly) about it. I want people to follow along with it’s progress and see how it is evolving and why things work the way they do. I want you to see what is influencing me into making design choices. Hopefully this will transform into a community of RulePlex users but I won’t get too ahead of myself. Let’s just start with clicking publish on this post.
