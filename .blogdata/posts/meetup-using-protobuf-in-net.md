Protocol Buffers is a method of serializing structured data. It is useful in developing programs to communicate with each other over a wire or for storing data.

On August 10<sup>th</sup> I will be speaking at the Orlando .NET User Group [meetup on Using Protobuf in .NET](https://www.meetup.com/ONETUG/events/241115418/). Come check it out if you are interested in this cool technology! The meetup starts at 6PM at the Melrose Tech Center inside the downtown Orlando Library. Afterwards the group heads over to Harp & Celt for food and drinks over more tech talk!
