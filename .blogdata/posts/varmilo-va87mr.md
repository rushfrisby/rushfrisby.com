The fact that I have 3 of these keyboards should tell you a lot.

I love almost everything about these boards. First of all they are super clean. No nasty branding anywhere. The floating keycaps make it easy to clean and look good. The key caps it comes with are front-printed which gives it a stealthly look. They are made of PBT plastic which is far superior to ABS and feel better too. They also use Cherry stabilizers which in my opinion are much better than Costar (feel + sound). Costar stabilizers are also super annoying to deal with when swapping keycaps whereas Cherry's are very easy. The USB cable can be routed to the left, middle, or right. I always keep it in the middle because symmetry is nice. You can order the case in different colors, have the option of many types of switches, and keycap colors.

The only thing I don't like is that the LEDs aren't RGB. This should be standard on every single board nowadays.

Let me tell you a little bit about each board that I have.

**Varmilo VA87MR #1**

It has a blue case and white PBT front printed keycaps as seen above. The switches are Gateron Blue with blue LED lights. I call it "my boy blue!" The white keycaps on the blue case have crisp and clean look that I like. The Gateron blues have a light feel and the clicks aren't that loud. The LEDs are bright and shine through the key caps at night so I usually keep them on the lowest level of brightness.

**Varmilo VA87MR #2**

I loved my first Varmilo VA87MR keyboard so much that I ordered another! This time I got it with Gateron Green switches, orange LED lights, a white case, and white key caps. The green switches are heavier which I prefer and I didn't have a tenkeyless board with greens yet. They aren't as crisp as Cherry MX Green but better than blues nonetheless. The all white/orange LED also looks pretty sweet.

**Varmilo VA87MR #3**

I got this one with a white case and mint key caps just because mint is wacky color. I've never used it with the mint key caps however. It has white LEDs and Cherry MX White switches. Cherry MX Whites are a smoother version of Cherry MX Greens and have a quieter click. I went with white on white on white because it makes the board great for swapping out and highlighting most key cap sets. I've got the [/dev/tty set](/dev-tty-keycaps/) on there now and it looks great.
