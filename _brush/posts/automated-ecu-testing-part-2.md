This post on my Automated ECU Testing project is dedicated to the construction of the room the ECUs will be located in. Between last week and now a lot has been done.

Walls patched up and carpet laid...

At this point I added a bit of flare with some RGB LED lighting which encircles the entire room...

The LEDs run off of a power source and an Arduino Uno. I found a nice smooth color cycle sketch to run. In the future it will be connected to our server and turn the lights different colors and/or flash to indicate the status of the system.

We will be adding shelving on Friday or early next week to hold all of the ECUs on.

More updates to come soon!
