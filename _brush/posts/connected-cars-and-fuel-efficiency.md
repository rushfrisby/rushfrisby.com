Last week I attended Automotive World’s 3-day conference. These are the thoughts I came away with.

### Connected Cars

The first day of the conference was dedicated to Connected Cars. What this translated to in speakers minds was really ***Security for* Connect Cars** because that’s what the majority of the day was spent talking about. The automotive industry is *very* susceptible to hackers. Let’s estimate that there are 0.05 vulnerabilities per 1000 LoC (lines of code). Car systems have anywhere from 50-150 million LoC depending on the make and model. Most of the known vulnerabilities aren’t getting patched because there’s no easy way to do it. For every vulnerability we know of, there are about 3 times as many which are undiscovered, and possibly being zero day exploited. That’s anywhere from 7,500 to 22,500 vulnerabilities in your car!

The automotive industry is completely behind in technology. They have a lot of concern around security but no one is leading by example. Tesla will crush them soon. Google, Apple, or Microsoft can come in and dominate the infotainment and connected car space without much effort. Manufacturers don’t like Silicon Valley. They are scared of them yet respect them at the same time. They want to replicate what Silicon Valley can do but don’t know exactly how to go about it.

### Autonomous Cars

The second day of the conference was dedicated to Autonomous Cars. I separated this day into [it’s own post](http://rushfrisby.com/autonomous-cars-are-a-long-way-off/).

### Fuel Efficiency

The third day of the conference was dedicated to fuel efficiency. A lot of time was spent talking about policies and regulations. I didn’t take away much from this other than car manufacturers don’t give a shit about fuel efficiency. The only reason they make cars more and more fuel efficient is because of the EPA and DOT.
