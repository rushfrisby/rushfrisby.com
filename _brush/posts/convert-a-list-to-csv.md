I've needed a tool that can convert a list of items per line to a comma separated list a lot recently. I found one online that was useful but it had no options. Also I can't seem to find it whenever I google "list to csv".

I decided to write my own and put it online so I won't have this problem. I figured others may find it useful as well. Here it is: [http://rushfrisby.github.io/tools/list-to-csv.html](http://rushfrisby.github.io/tools/list-to-csv.html)
