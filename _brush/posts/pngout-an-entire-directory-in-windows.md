I couldn’t find a good tool for running [pngout](http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm) on an entire directory so I wrote one real quick. A couple of things to note. The command line syntax is:

> **pngsout.exe <DirectoryPath> *<All arguments from here on out are passed directly to pngout>***

The path to pngout.exe is defined in pngsout.exe.config so you must edit that before you start!

You must have [.NET Framework 4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48137) installed.
