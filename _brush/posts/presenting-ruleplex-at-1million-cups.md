Today I presented my startup company, RulePlex, at 1Million Cups. Here is a video of the presentation.

I’ve gotten a few comments about it being too technical and that I should give a demo of the product while presenting. This was my first presentation to a large audience on the service and I think those ideas are great. I’ll be working them in for next time.
