I’ve been a professional software developer for over 14 years. I started on the Microsoft stack and have worked in classic ASP/.NET/SQL the entire time. Sometimes I think “the grass looks greener on the other side” meaning that other technology stacks look really impressive and there are lots of companies creating cool things using them. What’s my worth as a .NET developer to these other companies? If you know architecture and concepts in one stack can you be as valuable using another stack? In what ways would a primarily-one-stack company have for a developer in another stack?
