    <h2>Application Security and Single Sign On</h2>
    <time datetime="12/16/2016 6:10:20 PM -05:00">Published on Fri, 16 Dec 2016 23:10:20 GMT</time>
    <div class="content">
        <p>In 2017 I will be developing <a href="https://github.com/rushfrisby/AppSecSSO">a new, open source, application security and single sign on solution</a>. It will compete directly with <a href="https://www.onelogin.com/">OneLogin</a> and <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>. Since 2000 I have built four solutions just like this.</p>
<p>In 2000 I took my first stab at this for <a href="https://www.google.com/?q=EVLogix">EVLogix</a>. My solution consisted of a few classes and a few web pages that secured our main web app, using classic ASP. I'm sure it was completely insecure. I hope it's not still being used.</p>
<p>In 2008 I had a grand idea to create an &quot;application framework&quot; which provided a dashboard for users to launch their web applications and gave developers a way of managing apps and accounts. I was building user-management-type-stuff into every app I wrote and this would allow me to skip that and just get to the point of what each app was meant to do. I created a LLC and developed the source under it. Eventually I abandoned the project when I realized what I had built could be done better. It was .NET based but was using ASP.NET web forms and the API requests were parsed and constructed in a non-standard way.</p>
<p>In 2010 I built a new solution for the company I was working for at the time, <a href="http://www.digitalrisk.com/">Digital Risk</a>. The web portion was built using ASP.NET MVC and the API moved to a WCF service. This was much improved, however, some design choices were poor and I started securing other WCF services with it. This resulted in security overload and made it frustrating for other developers to use.</p>
<p>In 2014 I built another solution for <a href="http://derivesystems.com/">Derive Systems</a> (who I currently work for). The web portion and API are again written in ASP.NET MVC and WCF, but I didn't make any mistakes I had made previously. It's secure and easy for developers to use with web, mobile, and desktop apps.</p>
<p><strong>So why am I developing yet another solution?</strong></p>
<p>My primary reason is to use this as a way of learning <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/platform">.NET Core</a>. .NET Core is cross-platform so it can be hosted on <strong>Windows <em>and</em> Linux</strong>. I also want the solution to be open-source to promote broader use and gain input from different people. I am a big fan of <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> so I am hosting the source on there.</p>
<p>I haven't decided on one thing yet - whether the solution will be simultaneously used for profit or not. <a href="https://exceptionless.com/">Exceptionless</a> currently works on this model and they do a good job of it. I recently listened to a podcast on <a href="https://a16z.com/">Andreessen Horowitz</a> in which they said this model is gaining popularity. Using the solution for profit will affect the type of open-source community members that choose to contribute so I am taking that into consideration as well.</p>
<p>I am looking for community members who want to get involved early. If so, [shoot me an email](mailto:rush@rushfrisby.com?subject=Your AppSecSSO project), <a href="https://twitter.com/rushonerok/">hit me up on twitter</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/rushfrisby/AppSecSSO/issues">create some issues</a> on GitHub!</p>
