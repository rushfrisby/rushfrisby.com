    <h2>WASD CODE Keyboard</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p><img src="/img/keyboard/code_keyboard-1.png" alt="CODE_Green" /></p>
<p>I have three CODE keyboards. Two are full size and the third is tenkeyless. They all have black cases (bought them before white was an option). Two have Cherry MX Green switches and one has Cherry MX Clear switches. I bought the full size board with Green's first. I absolutely loved how the board and switches felt. It made typing <strong>fun</strong> and I cranked out a ton of (real) code on it. It was my first board with switches other than Cherry MX Browns. I was nervous that the clickiness would be too noisy so I ordered it with O-rings. I can't say that I preferred the O-rings though. I'm used to noisy keyboards at this point. The second CODE (tenkeyless) board I have I didn't order with O-rings. Cherry MX Green switches are by far my favorite!</p>
<p>The case has no markings or labeling which I am a fan of. A lot of nice boards have logos plastered on them and I find it to be an eye sore. The LEDs light up the white backplate nicely although I wish they were RGB LEDs instead of white.</p>
<p>My only other issue with the board is that my first one came with what seemed to have been painted keycaps and they started chipping after short use. It mostly started chipping around where the legends were, making them deformed and unreadable. My second and third boards did not have this problem however not as much typing was done on those keycaps.</p>
