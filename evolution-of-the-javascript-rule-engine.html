    <h2>Evolution of the JavaScript Rule Engine</h2>
    <time datetime="2/26/2015 11:50:54 AM -05:00">Published on Thu, 26 Feb 2015 16:50:54 GMT</time>
    <div class="content">
        <p>I was working on RulePlex this week and came across a couple of things I wanted to share. First is a change in the way that rules are “compiled”. You can’t really compile JavaScript per se but this is the process of how things came about working the way they do…</p>
<p>In the first iteration, JavaScript rules were executed individually. If there were 100 rules in a Policy I would execute 100 little JavaScript snippets for an incoming request. The snippets were “compiled” when the call to the API was made. I soon realized that this might be okay if a Policy had a few rules but for large Policies it was <em>slow</em> – even if I executed all of the snippets in parallel.</p>
<p>For the next iteration I took all of the rules and compiled them into one big script. In order to do this I had to wrap the rules with some advanced JavaScript techniques. Because this big script contains the results of every rule I had to append something unique to each result’s variable name – the rule’s <strong>Id</strong>. This makes the script look horrifying but I am okay with it for now (it’s not hurting performance). Executing one big script increased performance tremendously. Here is an example of what a Policy with 1 rule that simply returns <strong>true</strong> looks like compiled:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/rushfrisby/ac4aedf49ec4b1270c9e.js"></script>
<p>At the same time I had extended this technique to the C# rule engine. I took it a step further though and actually compiled C# rules into a DLL. I took the binary code for the DLL and stored it along with the Policy. I did the compilation whenever a rule in the Policy changed – not when the API was called like I had been doing with the JavaScript engine. When the API <em>was</em> called, I got the DLL’s binary data and loaded it into memory to be executed against the incoming data.</p>
<p>I mimicked the binary compilation and loading of the C# rules into the JavaScript engine as well. The thing is, I never really liked doing it in the JavaScript engine because I had to convert the compiled script (text) to binary, so I could store it in the same database field, and then from binary back to text when it was time to be executed. In C# it made sense but not in JavaScript. Now that the C# engine is gone I had a chance to go back and change this.</p>
<p>Presently, when rules are changed (or added/deleted/etc), RulePlex will compile it’s big script during the save of the rule. I saves it to the Policy as text. When the API is called the script is retrieved and executed.</p>
<p>I haven’t thought about tweaking this process any more but I may in the future. Instead I have been thinking about how this affects the workflow from a business perspective. The more I think about it the more I like the changes that I’ve made. If I ever change how I “compile” the big script it won’t affect policies that are currently <em>working</em> (a certain way). What if I’ve got a bug in the script that you’ve accounted for in you’re rules, knowingly or unknowingly. If I change how the script is compiled and it’s being compiled during the API request then it could be different day-by-day without any actions by you. This is bad because I may have fixed or introduced a bug that changes the results. Now the application you’ve integrated with RulePlex is broken!</p>
<p>The ideal workflow is that there are two copies of the same Policy, maybe even three, or N. One copy would be designated as a Production copy, while the others are for Dev/Staging/whatever. When the engine changes, you want to test those changes in a non-Production environment first. When you’ve verified that the changes do not affect your application then that non-Production copy can be promoted to Production. This also applies to the workflow of building out a Policy too, not just back-end changes to the engine. The concept of environments will be included in the next version of RulePlex.</p>
