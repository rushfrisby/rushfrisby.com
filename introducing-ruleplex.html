    <h2>Introducing RulePlex</h2>
    <time datetime="1/29/2015 12:00:00 AM -05:00">Published on Thu, 29 Jan 2015 05:00:00 GMT</time>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Almost a year ago I began on a mission to create the first cloud-based rules engine. I called it <a href="https://ruleplex.com">RulePlex</a>. After a few months of work I had succeeded. A lot of rules engines can be run (on virtual machines) in the cloud but mine was designed with a cloud-first approach in mind. On top of being cloud-based I had a couple of other goals I wanted for the engine:</p>
<p><img src="/img/post/First_flight2.png" alt="The Wright brothers first flight." /></p>
</div>- Allow rules to be written in any language
- Allow integration with any app
- Make it incredibly secure
- Keep the cost low
<p>I accomplished all of these. The engine was awesome. When I was at a good place to ease up on the development, I did, and started to connect with as many people as I could trying to drum up business. I contacted all of my developer buddies, business contacts, previous employers… but no one was interested. I tried to generate business by presenting my software at business start-up events like <a href="http://orlando.sites.1millioncups.com/">1MillionCups</a>. I tried Google Adwords. I threw a hail mary to <a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman">Scott Hanselman</a> hoping he would do a <a href="http://hanselminutes.com/">hanselminutes</a> with me. I even gave the service away for free just to get signups so people would look at it… but all of my attempts at getting the business going failed. I don’t think I did enough even though it may sound like I had.</p>
<p><strong>I’m not giving up.</strong></p>
<p><em>I’m changing things up!</em></p>
<p>Instead of being cloud-based I am falling in line with all of the other rule engines. RulePlex will be an on-premise install. It can still be run in the cloud but it won’t be touted as the first cloud-based rules engine any more. It’s nice that I was able to accomplish that feat but ultimately I think proximity to where it will be used will benefit companies more. The latency between the cloud an a corporate network is too much when apps need instant results.</p>
<p>Another thing I am changing is the ability to write rules in any language. I had support for JavaScript, C#, VB.NET, Ruby, and Python – but from now on rules will only be written in JavaScript. By going with only one language it will save development time tremendously. I chose JavaScript because it is the most widely used language today. It’s also not going anywhere anytime soon. It has become an incredible server side language thanks to <a href="https://code.google.com/p/v8/">V8</a> and the popularity of <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. It’s flexible/forgiving thanks to dynamic typing and business users can learn the basics easily.</p>
<p>The last thing I will be doing is blogging a lot more about RulePlex. I’ve been working on it for almost a year and I haven’t written anything (directly) about it. I want people to follow along with it’s progress and see how it is evolving and why things work the way they do. I want you to see what is influencing me into making design choices. Hopefully this will transform into a community of RulePlex users but I won’t get too ahead of myself. Let’s just start with clicking publish on this post.</p>
