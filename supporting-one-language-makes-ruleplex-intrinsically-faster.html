    <h2>Supporting One Language Makes RulePlex Intrinsically Faster</h2>
    <time datetime="2/4/2015 7:54:13 AM -05:00">Published on Wed, 04 Feb 2015 12:54:13 GMT</time>
    <div class="content">
        <p>In my previous post I wrote that one of the decisions I made about RulePlex was to only support one rule language. This will make the engine intrinsically faster and I’ll show you why.</p>
<p>When you create a Policy (a set of rules) one of the options you are given is to chose a rule language. When it’s time to run your rules you provide the data and the Name or Id of the policy. From that Name/Id the Policy is found which will tell us the rule language. Once we know the language we can begin processing the rules.</p>
<p>At first you might think of writing code for this that fits into a switch pattern. I might look something like this:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/rushfrisby/46e42ade6fbe1ef5e179.js"></script>
<p>Some things to note here – I am using enums and I left out the implementation of how the rules are processed. That’s because I just want to talk about the switch pattern. It’s not the cleanest way of writing this. My example only has 3 cases but the worst switch I’ve ever seen had over 80 cases, used strings for the case values, and had an average of 12 lines per case – over 1000 lines in total! This is an amplification of my point which makes it very clear, that, switches can become unreadable and hard to maintain. Whenever you have a switch statement you should ask yourself if <a href="http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/gilf/2009/11/22/applying-strategy-pattern-instead-of-using-switch-statements/">using a Strategy pattern</a> makes more sense.</p>
<p>In RulePlex I used the Strategy Pattern, something to the effect of this:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/rushfrisby/8368c0393accbee4cd97.js"></script>
<p>The downside to this pattern is that a dictionary lookup is slower than a switch statement. The upside is that it cleans up code very nicely. I could have added support for 10 new rule languages and the lookup code would have stayed the same. It’s up to you to decide between these trade-offs. My original goal was to support as many languages as possible in RulePlex so using the Strategy Pattern would have saved me headache down the road.</p>
<p>That all changes now that RulePlex is only using JavaScript rules. I don’t need the strategy pattern and I don’t even need a switch statement. Instead I can new-up a JavaScriptRuleEngine and call Execute() on it. Faster and cleaner!</p>
<p>On a side note (back to my comment on using enums): You should <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/9501967/266804">never use “magic strings”</a>. Your world will be a much better place without them.</p>
