<p>These keycaps are based on the profile from IBM beamspring terminals of the 1970s, this custom set is the first-ever fully sculpted set of dye-sublimated PBT keycaps in Hi-Profile.</p>
<p>Many computer terminals of old were constructed with a slanted switch layout from front to back. Because of that slant the keycaps sat at an angle atop the switches. This set is a reimagination of that unique slanted build, but optimized for modern keyboards. Thanks to significant 3D modeling work from Matt3o the MT3 profile is born!</p>
<p>The built quality of this set is impeccable. The plastic is think and the dye-sublimated are super clean and have a fantastic sound. The lip and cup on the top of the caps contour finger tips perfectly. On top of that the color tone is very pleasing. I got the RGB modifiers which give the set a pop of color.</p>
<p>By far my favorite keycaps ever!</p>

<p>The fact that I have 3 of these keyboards should tell you a lot.</p>
<p>I love almost everything about these boards. First of all they are super clean. No nasty branding anywhere. The floating keycaps make it easy to clean and look good. The key caps it comes with are front-printed which gives it a stealthly look. They are made of PBT plastic which is far superior to ABS and feel better too. They also use Cherry stabilizers which in my opinion are much better than Costar (feel + sound). Costar stabilizers are also super annoying to deal with when swapping keycaps whereas Cherry's are very easy. The USB cable can be routed to the left, middle, or right. I always keep it in the middle because symmetry is nice. You can order the case in different colors, have the option of many types of switches, and keycap colors.</p>
<p>The only thing I don't like is that the LEDs aren't RGB. This should be standard on every single board nowadays.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a little bit about each board that I have.</p>
<p><strong>Varmilo VA87MR #1</strong>
<img src="/img/keyboard/Varmilo_VA87MR.jpg" alt="Varmilo_VA87MR" />
It has a blue case and white PBT front printed keycaps as seen above. The switches are Gateron Blue with blue LED lights. I call it &quot;my boy blue!&quot; The white keycaps on the blue case have crisp and clean look that I like. The Gateron blues have a light feel and the clicks aren't that loud. The LEDs are bright and shine through the key caps at night so I usually keep them on the lowest level of brightness.</p>
<p><strong>Varmilo VA87MR #2</strong><br />
<img src="/img/keyboard/Varmilo_VA87MR_2.jpg" alt="Varmilo_VA87MR" />
I loved my first Varmilo VA87MR keyboard so much that I ordered another! This time I got it with Gateron Green switches, orange LED lights, a white case, and white key caps. The green switches are heavier which I prefer and I didn't have a tenkeyless board with greens yet. They aren't as crisp as Cherry MX Green but better than blues nonetheless. The all white/orange LED also looks pretty sweet.</p>
<p><strong>Varmilo VA87MR #3</strong>
<img src="/img/keyboard/varmilo_mint.png" alt="Varmilo_VA87MR" />
I got this one with a white case and mint key caps just because mint is wacky color. I've never used it with the mint key caps however. It has white LEDs and Cherry MX White switches. Cherry MX Whites are a smoother version of Cherry MX Greens and have a quieter click. I went with white on white on white because it makes the board great for swapping out and highlighting most key cap sets. I've got the <a href="/dev-tty-keycaps/">/dev/tty set</a> on there now and it looks great.</p>

<p><img src="/img/keyboard/code_keyboard-1.png" alt="CODE_Green" /></p>
<p>I have three CODE keyboards. Two are full size and the third is tenkeyless. They all have black cases (bought them before white was an option). Two have Cherry MX Green switches and one has Cherry MX Clear switches. I bought the full size board with Green's first. I absolutely loved how the board and switches felt. It made typing <strong>fun</strong> and I cranked out a ton of (real) code on it. It was my first board with switches other than Cherry MX Browns. I was nervous that the clickiness would be too noisy so I ordered it with O-rings. I can't say that I preferred the O-rings though. I'm used to noisy keyboards at this point. The second CODE (tenkeyless) board I have I didn't order with O-rings. Cherry MX Green switches are by far my favorite!</p>
<p>The case has no markings or labeling which I am a fan of. A lot of nice boards have logos plastered on them and I find it to be an eye sore. The LEDs light up the white backplate nicely although I wish they were RGB LEDs instead of white.</p>
<p>My only other issue with the board is that my first one came with what seemed to have been painted keycaps and they started chipping after short use. It mostly started chipping around where the legends were, making them deformed and unreadable. My second and third boards did not have this problem however not as much typing was done on those keycaps.</p>

**Das Keyboard Model S Professional**  
![DAS_Model_S_Pro](/img/keyboard/DAS_Model_S_Pro-1024x364.jpg)
This was the first mechanical keyboard I bought in 2012. I bought it with the intention that it would be good to get me introduced to mechanical keyboards. The brown switches were attractive because they weren’t too noisy and had some tactile feel.

Since buying this keyboard I have swapped the Brown switches for Gateron Green ones, changed the blue LED indicator lights to red, and replaced the key caps with a charcoal gray set. It now looks like this...
![Das Model S Pro with Mods](/img/keyboard/das_mod.png)

**Max Keyboard Nighthawk X8**  
![Max_Nighthawk_X8](/img/keyboard/Max_Nighthawk_X8-1024x355.jpg)
This was my second keyboard and I bought it primarily for the back-lighting. I wasn’t comfortable experimenting with different switches at the time which I realize afterwards was something I should have changed.

**Royal Kludge RG-987/928**  
![Royal_Kludge_RG-987-928](/img/keyboard/Royal_Kludge_RG-987-928-1024x403.jpg)
My first ten keyless board (that’s what they call keyboards without the numpad). I wanted to try a smaller form factor out which I ended up liking a lot. The RGB backlighting was really cool. Also the white case and keys were different than my previous boards. This one has Black switches which are linear and have a high actuation force. I didn’t like them at first but I got used to them. I ended up switching the key caps that came with the board for some double shot PBT caps which have more professional looking legends on them. I also added large O-rings to lower the noise level.

**Vortex POK3R (Poker 3)**  
![Vortex_POK3R](/img/keyboard/Vortex_POK3R-1024x354.jpg)
The form factor on the board is called a 60%. It doesn’t have a dedicated arrow pad and special keys. It also doesn’t have a function key row. Instead there is a “function key” which makes each key serve double duty. For example FN+H is the “Home” key. It also comes with multiple “layers” which means you can hit FN+Layer2 (layer 2, 3, and 4 are programmable, layer 1 is the standard default layout). When you switch to an alternate layer you can program the keys to be anything you want – a single key press, combination of key presses, whatever. I like how small the keyboard is because it looks really elite on my desk but it’s hard to get used to. I’ve only been using it for a couple of weeks and every day seems to be getting easier use. The switches are Clear – they are linear and have a slightly higher actuation force than Black. I like Clear over Black they feel crisp when you type. The caps are PBT and there is no back-lighting. There are a couple of LEDs that come on behind the keys but it is only to indicate when caps lock or an alternative layer is selected.

**The WhiteFox Keyboard**  
![whitefox](/img/keyboard/whitefox-1024x373.jpg)
I haven’t got this keyboard yet. It was designed by a keyboard enthusiast named “matt3o” with the help of the mechanical keyboard community. It’s a 65% form factor which gives it the dedicated arrow keys, and some special function keys, but for everything else it will require using a Function key to access. The keys are a white cream color combined with some blue colored keys which look great. They key caps themselves are a DSA profile which I have never tried before. There will be white back-lighting which I think will look nice on the silver back-plate. I got this board with the Zealios 67g Tactile (Purple) switches. These switches, like the keyboard, are also designed by a member of the mechanical keyboard enthusiast community. I got the tactile version since I hear these switches are as smooth as butter and I wanted some feedback when I type. They have a pretty high actual force as well. I think it will translate to a superior typing experience. I will write up a full review when I get the keyboard in hand!

**Ajazz AK33 RGB**
![Varmilo_VA87MR](/img/keyboard/ajazz_ak33.png)
I got this board primarily for the LED backlighting because it has so many options. [Check out a video of the options here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzoZ7rG0x0c&t=6m34s). The board is pretty cheap at $60 on Amazon but I got it on a lightning deal for $48. The form factor is a 65% but it's got a function key row which makes it a little more _functional_. But serious, it does make it more practical for everyday use. It's got Zorro blue switches. The Zorro brand is new to me. This gave it just the right amount of uniqueness from my other boards and I was willing to give it a try.

<section class='post-content'>
<p>I recently purchased a <a href="http://www.maxkeyboard.com/max-keyboard-nighthawk-x8-blue-backlit-mechanical-keyboard.html">Max Nighthawk X8 mechanical keyboard</a>(orange backlight). This is the second mechanical keyboard that I’ve bought. The other is a <a href="http://shop.daskeyboard.com/products/das-keyboard-professional-model-s">Das Keyboard S Pro</a> which I will use as a comparison on some notes.</p>
<h3>Unboxing</h3>
<p>Overall the packaging is very nice. The box seems a little big for the keyboard but there is a lot of padding to protect your new baby. The palm rest which feels like a gel pad is protecting the underside of the keyboard. The board itself is wedged between foam blocks on either end. I don’t remember there being any padding on top. That shouldn’t be a problem because it was packed within another box filled will foam peanuts to protect the top. There is a plastic bag covering the keyboard which protects it from dust and debris. The only thing I did not like was a slip cover over the keyboard box. I’d rather that the image/info be printed directly on the box. The slip cover though is a high end matte black and very nice. The box itself is matte black and stiff. You can tell it’s quality cardboard and what’s protecting underneath is something special.</p>
<h3>Appearance and Function</h3>
<p>The first thing I noticed was the matte black texture of the keyboard and keys. It has a soft look and velvet feel to it. The weight of the keyboard is significant but doesn’t feel as heavy as my Das Keyboard. There are no distracting logos which is good because I place a high value on my desk looking slick and streamlined/professional. There is a thin ridge and trench outlining the entire keyboard which, as soon as I saw it, knew would collect dust and be hard to clean. I haven’t had the keyboard long enough for that to happen but I know eventually it will. The braided cable is sturdy to the point of being rigid. Once you hook it up though, who cares? The cable connection to the keyboard is off-centered to the right. I don’t have a problem with this but I know others do. The cable is long enough that it’s a non-issue for me – and my rig is setup to the left of my desk. The back stand legs are decent and leave the keyboard at a good angle. I haven’t had any problems typing because of that. The rubber pads under the lower part of the bottom are smaller than the Das Keyboard. I wish they were bigger. The USB and audio ports I have not used at all because I have a USB powered headset that plugs into the front of my tower. The USB ports on the keyboard are low powered which limits their use. I feel like they could have done without them and lowered the cost a little.</p>
<h3>Keys</h3>
<p>The key lettering is centered which I do not prefer but I know that is due to the back light position which is in the center. The function keys row doubles as media keys and the media function symbol is written below the F#. This means the LED cannot illuminate the media key symbol because the connector to the key cap is blocking the light. This makes me sad. Also the space bar has a long bar of clear plastic for the LED to shine through but 1 LED is not enough to illuminate the entire bar. If there were 2 or 3 LEDs under the space bar it would look more impressive. The numlock, capslock, and “G” (gamemode) notification area is well lit. Adjusting the LED brightness is easy and the “breathing” mode is very cool.</p>
<p>The X8 comes with Cherry Brown MX switches which provide a soft tactile bump and are known to be clicky. Compared to my Das Keyboard it sounds less clicky and softer to the touch. This may be due to the finish of the keyboard which is that velvet matte finish. The key faces are a little small. They seem to fall somewhere between cylindrical and spherical whereas the Das Keyboard is a flatter cylindrical shape. I would like it if the key faces were larger like the Das Keyboard because I have fat fingers.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Overall I am very impressed with this keyboard and see myself typing and gaming on it for a long time. It is almost exactly what I was looking for, just needs a few tweaks.</p>
